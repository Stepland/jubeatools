"""
This module contains code for the different formats read by "jubeat analyser".

"jubeat analyser" is a Windows program that can play back chart files and
export them to video files, it can also be used as a jubeat simulator.

"memo" is a vague term that refers to several slightly different formats.
My understanding is that they were all originally derived from the (somewhat)
human-readable format choosen by websites like jubeat memo or cosmos memo.
These websites would provide text transcripts of official jubeat charts as
training material for hardcore players.

The machine-readable variants or these text formats are partially documented
(in japanese) on these pages :
